# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction - Final NTI Project (July 2024)

This repository contains our **final team project at NTI**, completed in **July 2024**, which focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using various machine learning models and techniques. The project combines **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **classification modeling** to draw insights and make accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze heart disease dataset to understand feature relationships
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Apply classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM)
- Evaluate and compare models using appropriate metrics
- Visualize findings and model performance

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used contains medical attributes relevant to heart disease diagnosis, such as:

- `age`
- `sex`
- `cp` (chest pain type)
- `trestbps` (resting blood pressure)
- `chol` (serum cholesterol)
- `fbs` (fasting blood sugar)
- `restecg`, `thalach`, `exang`, etc.

**Target Variable:**
- `target` (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

---

## 📈 EDA Highlights

- Distribution analysis using histograms & count plots
- Correlation heatmap to identify highly correlated features
- Boxplots and violin plots to compare features across the target

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler
- Train-test split

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree

---

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC Curve & AUC Score
